# VR5000 LCD Display Replacement
Older Yaesu VR-5000 LCD displays often suffer from loss of vertical LCD lines. Since the original displays are not available on eBay or other sources, we have to create another replacement. Inspired by *kakiralime* [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIxD9E-iZ5w) I have implemented similar solution. Unfortunately I was not able to contact the author, so I decided to implement it myself.


## Hardware
